### **Introduction to Databases**
A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated efficiently. It allows storing data in a structured manner, making it easy to retrieve and manipulate.

### **Types of Databases**
1. **Relational Databases (SQL)**
   - Uses structured schema (tables with rows and columns).
   - Data is stored in a tabular format.
   - Ensures ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server.

2. **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**
   - Schema-less or dynamic schema.
   - Can store data in different formats like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-columns.
   - Provides high scalability and flexibility.
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Firebase.

### **SQL vs NoSQL**
| Feature       | SQL (Relational)  | NoSQL (Non-Relational)  |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Structure    | Tables (rows & columns) | Documents, Key-Value, Graphs |
| Schema       | Fixed schema     | Dynamic schema |
| Scalability  | Vertical Scaling | Horizontal Scaling |
| Transactions | ACID Compliance  | BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) |
| Query Language | SQL | Query languages like MongoDB Query Language (MQL) |
| Use Case     | Structured Data, Banking, ERP | Big Data, Real-time apps, JSON-based |

### **MongoDB and PyMongo CRUD Operations**
MongoDB is a **NoSQL document-based database**, and **PyMongo** is a Python library to interact with MongoDB.

#### **1. Install PyMongo**
```sh
pip install pymongo
```

#### **2. Connect to MongoDB**
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["students_db"]
collection = db["students"]
```

---

### **CRUD Operations in PyMongo**

#### **Create (Insert Data)**
```python
# Insert One
student = {"name": "Ali", "age": 22, "course": "Database"}
collection.insert_one(student)

# Insert Multiple
students = [
    {"name": "Sara", "age": 21, "course": "AI"},
    {"name": "Ahmed", "age": 23, "course": "Web Dev"}
]
collection.insert_many(students)
```

---

#### **Read (Retrieve Data)**
```python
# Find One
student = collection.find_one({"name": "Ali"})
print(student)

# Find All
for student in collection.find():
    print(student)

# Find with Condition
for student in collection.find({"course": "AI"}):
    print(student)
```

---

#### **Update (Modify Data)**
```python
# Update One
collection.update_one({"name": "Ali"}, {"$set": {"age": 23}})

# Update Many
collection.update_many({"course": "AI"}, {"$set": {"course": "Machine Learning"}})
```

---

#### **Delete (Remove Data)**
```python
# Delete One
collection.delete_one({"name": "Ali"})

# Delete Many
collection.delete_many({"course": "Machine Learning"})
```

### **Bonus: Advanced MongoDB Queries**
- **Sorting**: `collection.find().sort("age", -1)` (Descending)
- **Limiting Results**: `collection.find().limit(5)`
- **Projection (Selecting Fields)**: `collection.find({}, {"_id": 0, "name": 1})`
