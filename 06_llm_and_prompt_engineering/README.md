**list of important LLM generation settings**:

---

| Setting             | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| **temperature**      | Controls randomness globally. (0 = focused, 1 = creative) |
| **top_p**            | Controls *how many words* are considered when picking. |
| **top_k**            | Only pick from the top **k** highest probability words (hard limit). |
| **max_tokens**       | Maximum number of tokens (words/characters) the model can generate. |
| **frequency_penalty**| Penalizes words that repeat too much. (Helps avoid loops) |
| **presence_penalty** | Encourages introducing *new* topics into the conversation. |
| **stop_sequences**   | If the model outputs a certain word/phrase, **it stops** immediately. |
| **logit_bias**       | Force the model to prefer or avoid specific words or tokens. (advanced control) |

---

**Slightly deeper:**

- `top_k`:  
  ➔ Like *top_p*, but instead of probability mass, you say: "Only look at top 5 words," for example.

- `frequency_penalty`:  
  ➔ "Don’t keep repeating the same word over and over!"

- `presence_penalty`:  
  ➔ "Talk about new stuff, not just variations of what’s already said."

---

**Simple grouping:**

| Randomness | temperature, top_p, top_k |
| Length Control | max_tokens |
| Repetition Control | frequency_penalty, presence_penalty |
| Special Handling | stop_sequences, logit_bias |

---

**Example combo you might use:**
```python
llm = GoogleGenerativeAI(
    model="gemini-1.5-flash",
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    top_k=50,
    max_tokens=500,
    frequency_penalty=0.2,
    presence_penalty=0.3,
    stop_sequences=["User:", "Assistant:"]
)
```

✅ **Common Across Gemini, GPT, Grok, DeepSeek**:
- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `max_tokens`
- `stop`
- (mostly) `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`

❗ **Unique Differences:**

| Model     | Unique Extras                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Gemini** | Supports `top_k`                             |
| **GPT**    | Supports `logit_bias`                        |
| **Grok**   | Standard only (no extras yet)                |
| **DeepSeek** | No `top_k`, no `logit_bias`, some penalties vary |

---

**Quick Summary**:

| What You Want                          | Best Model     |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Force/ban certain words (logit bias)** | GPT only       |
| **Choose top_k words**                  | Gemini only    |
| **Pure simple generation**              | Grok, DeepSeek |

---

**One Golden Tip:**  
> If you want your code **universal** across **Gemini, GPT, Grok, DeepSeek**, just stick to:  
> `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `stop_sequences`, and *optionally* penalties.
